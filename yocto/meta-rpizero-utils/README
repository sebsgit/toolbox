This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-rpizero-utils layer.

Provides the "rpizero-extended-image" image for Raspberry Pi Zero W with the following features:
* enabled ssh via the 'ssh' file in the "/boot" partition
* updated wpa_supplicant.conf file with a predefined SSID/password for the WiFi connection
* setup-wifi script which enables the wlan0 interface and takes care of the board IP address

Building this layer requires the user to create a "network_settings.inc" file in the "recipes-connectivity" folder.
The file should define the following variables:

WIFI_SSID = "YourNetworkName"
WIFI_PASSWD = "passwd"
ROUTER_IP = "192.168.0.1"
RPI_LOCAL_IP = "192.168.0.99"

The "ROUTER_IP" should be set to the IP address of the network gateway node. On linux this can be checked with "route -n" command.
The "RPI_LOCAL_IP" should be set to the desired IP address of the raspberry pi device in the local network.
The WIFI_SSID / WIFI_PASSWD should be set to allow the raspberry pi device to connect to the local wifi.
