This small test project explores adding platform devices to the linux kernel using device tree
file and device tree overlays.
The device tree node properties are extracted in the device driver to allocate and configure the device nodes under /dev/.
File uEnv.txt contains the u-boot commands to load the linux image, load the device tree blob
and patch it using the device tree overlay blob binary.
